I used copilot more so as a reference to help ease the troubles of being stuck on insufficient code. there are some instances when copilot offers ways to complete things that i do not fully understand yet in which case I will find my own way to do things but overall it is very effective at making a workload such as this project a lot less stressful. Copilot sped up my work due to its constant anticipation of what the next line of code should be which helped me out a lot when i would get to new blocks of code. overall I believe the use of copilot in coding is a very positive way of itegrating AI into the realm of coding and it enhances the capibilities of those building applications.
